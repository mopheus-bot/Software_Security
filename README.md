# Software Security

### Client and Software Requirements:

  Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company, sought to modernize its operations by enhancing the security of its software application. 
They wanted to address security vulnerabilities in their web application, particularly regarding the secure transfer of sensitive client data and 
financial information. The key issue was to protect client data and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial information.

### Secure Coding and Software Security Importance:

  I excelled in identifying and addressing Artemis Financial's software security vulnerabilities. By conducting a thorough vulnerability assessment, 
I proactively identified and remedied weaknesses in the software, thus reducing the potential for data breaches and security incidents. Coding securely 
is crucial as it safeguards data, preserves customer trust, and prevents costly security breaches. Software security adds immense value to a company's 
overall wellbeing by protecting its reputation, customer trust, and financial stability.

### Challenges and Helpful Aspects of Vulnerability Assessment:

  One challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities without disrupting the existing 
functionality of the software. However, this challenge was helpful in strengthening our understanding of balancing security and functionality, a 
critical skill in software development.

### Increasing Layers of Security and Future Vulnerability Assessment:

  I increased layers of security by implementing secure communication, data integrity checks, secure coding practices, and adhering to industry-standard 
best practices. In the future, I would utilize comprehensive vulnerability assessment tools and methodologies, such as regular penetration testing, 
automated code analysis, and continuous monitoring, to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation techniques.

### Ensuring Functional and Secure Code:

  To ensure functional and secure code, I conducted functional and static testing. I executed functional tests to validate the software's functionality, 
and I used static analysis to identify security vulnerabilities in the code. After refactoring, I checked for new vulnerabilities through static analysis, 
ensuring that code changes did not introduce fresh security risks.

### Resources and Tools for Future Tasks:

  Valuable resources, tools, and coding practices used in this assignment included Java Keytool for certificate generation, industry-standard best practices 
for secure coding, cryptographic libraries for hash algorithms, and vulnerability assessment tools like OWASP Dependency-Check. These resources and practices 
are transferable and will be beneficial in future assignments or tasks requiring security enhancements.

### Examples for Future Employers:

  From this assignment, I can showcase the ability to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments, implement security enhancements, and adhere to secure 
coding practices. I can present artifacts such as the CER file demonstrating certificate generation, checksum verification screenshots, refactored code with 
comments on security improvements, and reports from static analysis tools. These examples demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and experience in enhancing 
software security, a vital skill set in the software development industry.
